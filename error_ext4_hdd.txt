Had installed and tried mounting/configuring an ext4 HDD (with Ubuntu).
Could only make directories of access through sudo in command line.
Had no rights otherwise.

The solution was given in: https://askubuntu.com/questions/514451/new-hdd-formating-on-ext4-root-permission
Ran: sudo chmod -R a+rw /media/name_of_HDD
