These are files for automatically generate gain and shift values for this experiment. (OCL 186W(alpha,d)188Re). This calibrates for a peak i the proton banana and the g.s. in the tritsium. 

The Qkinz values are hardcoded in the python file, and importing the peaks from the data is found by running peaks2D software from OCL.

This is a linear fit and the coefficiants 5 (for E) and 2.5 (for dE) are there because of the initial gain in the data I got the peaks from. (See the plain gainshifts-file in the OCL user code software.)
